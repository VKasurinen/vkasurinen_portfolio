            Hi, I'm a 20-year-old computer science student.
            After upper secondary school, I was interested in
            making software and coding in general, and
            because of this, I am now studying computer
            science for the second year
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-xl">
            By nature, I am
            determined, calm and confident. I like to work in
            teams, and I am very motivated to try my skills on
            the software development side. I'm not afraid to
            work under pressure, and if I need to learn
            something I've usually learned it and completed the
            required task. So, I am quick learner and open to
            new information.
            </p>
